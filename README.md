# Frank-Hertz-experiment

## Overview
An experiment which demonstrated the existence of excited states in mercury atoms, helping to confirm the quantum theory which predicted that electrons occupied only discrete, quantized energy states.

This project automates the readings and handles the graph so that you can easily compute the electron orbits' energies
